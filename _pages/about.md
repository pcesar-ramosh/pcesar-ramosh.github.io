I am an economist with a postgraduate specialization in Quantitative Methods for Economic Analysis. I hold a Master’s degree in [Economic Engineering](https://unifieecs.wixsite.com/msc-econ-engineering) from the National University of Engineering (UNI). I currently work as a researcher at the Ministry of Economy, providing policy advisory support. Additionally, I serve as a Research Assistant at [Research Institute in Economics and Finance](https://ri-ef.com/) (RIEF).

Beyond my research work, I also contribute as a peer reviewer for academic journals and have experience teaching and delivering lectures on economics-related topics.

My research focuses on **Macroeconomics, Finance, and Microeconomics**, with a particular emphasis on:  

- Heterogeneous agents in asset pricing and macroeconomics  
- Interaction between fiscal and monetary policy  
- Empirical macro-finance  
- Informal labor markets  
- Applied econometrics  
- Machine learning applications in economics
